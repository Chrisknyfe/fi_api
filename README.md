# Flying Islands Modding API
This is the Flying Islands Modding API and public wiki. I'm gonna use this to publish any public-facing file formats or APIs, and create a wiki with various internal instruction manuals. I dunno I could've spent $$ on a private wiki on github but I'm lazy.

I'mma get some coffee now. brb.
